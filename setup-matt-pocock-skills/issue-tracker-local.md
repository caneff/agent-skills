# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` — never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading
- **Relationships (parent, blocked-by, type)**: no tracker API — record these as plain lines near the top of the ticket file:
  - Parent: a `Part of <path>` line pointing at the parent spec/map file, if this ticket has one.
  - Dependencies: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line listing the ticket numbers that must resolve first.
  - Type: a `Type:` line naming the ticket kind, when the workflow needs one (see Wayfinding operations below).

## Grilling gate on new tickets

When filing a ticket, route it to whoever acts on it next, using two questions.

**1. Does it need grilling** — an open design decision, a tradeoff, or a departure from a documented standard that should be stress-tested before any code is written?

- **Yes, tracked in a wayfinder map**: no `ready-for-*` label. The wayfinder flow owns it — it lives as a `wayfinder:grilling` child of the map and is handled there.
- **Yes, standalone** (not part of a wayfinder map): label it `ready-for-human`. A human grills the decision, then implements.

**2. If it does not need grilling, can the AFK agent build it end to end?**

- **Yes** — fully specified, mechanical, no human judgment or hands needed (a boundary move, reusing an existing helper, a refactor): label it `ready-for-agent`. This is the default for tracer-bullet work.
- **No** — specified, but it needs a human touch (a delicate change, a taste call, credentials or secrets, something you want to write yourself): label it `ready-for-human`.

So `ready-for-human` covers both a standalone grilling ticket and any specified ticket a human should build. `ready-for-agent` is only for work the agent can take unattended.

Never file a ticket label-less. A bare issue reads as *untriaged / unknown*, not as a signal to anyone — so every ticket leaves the gate with exactly one routing label: a `ready-*` label, a `wayfinder:*` label when a map owns it, or `backlog` when the work is real and its turn has not come. Wanting a human to see or grill it is `ready-for-human`, never the absence of a label. The one exception to the routing labels is `needs-triage`: use it only when you are genuinely unsure the ticket is ready to start, or unsure which label attaches, and say in the body what is in doubt.

A quick sanity check the implementer can do while building (read the code, confirm one behavior) is neither grilling nor a human touch — write the constraint into the ticket and still mark it `ready-for-agent`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` — the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body.
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
